# Student Performance Analysis Questions

Here are some questions to guide your analysis of `student_performance.csv`.

## 🟢 Basic
1.  **Load the data**: Read `student_performance.csv` into a DataFrame.
2.  **Average Age**: What is the average age of the students?
3.  **Gender Count**: How many male and female students are there?
4.  **Attendance Check**: Who has the highest attendance?

## 🟡 Intermediate
5.  **Study Correlation**: Is there a correlation between `StudyHours` and `MathScore`?
6.  **Subject Average**: What is the average score for Math, Science, and English?
7.  **Extracurriculars**: Do students with `Extracurricular` activities have higher average grades?
8.  **Passing Grade**: How many students scored above 80 in all three subjects?

## 🔴 Advanced
9.  **Performance Cluster**: Create a new column `AverageScore`. Group students into 'High' (>90), 'Medium' (75-90), and 'Low' (<75) performance categories.
10. **Age vs Performance**: Does age have any impact on the `AverageScore`?
11. **Predictive Analysis (Bonus)**: Can you predict `MathScore` based on `StudyHours` using a simple linear regression?
