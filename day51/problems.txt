# MongoDB Real Estate Practice Problems

Use the provided `real_estate.json` dataset to solve these problems.

## 0. Setup
**Import the data:**
First, import the JSON file into your MongoDB database. You can use MongoDB Compass or the command line tool `mongoimport`.
```bash
mongoimport --db real_estate_db --collection properties --file real_estate.json --jsonArray
```

## 1. Basic Retrieval
1.  **Find All**: Write a query to retrieve all documents in the collection.
2.  **Filter by Type**: Find all properties where the `type` is "House".
3.  **Filter by Price**: Find all properties with a `price` less than $200,000.
4.  **Filter by Agent**: Find all properties listed by "Mike Brown".

## 2. Logical Operators
5.  **And Condition**: Find properties that are "Houses" AND have at least 3 bedrooms.
6.  **Or Condition**: Find properties that are either "Condo" OR "Apartment".
7.  **Range**: Find properties built between 2000 and 2015 (inclusive).

## 3. Array Queries
8.  **Exact Match**: Find properties that have exactly these amenities: ["Gym", "Pool"]. (Note: Order matters in exact array match, try to find one that contains *at least* these if exact match yields nothing, but for this problem try exact).
9.  **Contains**: Find all properties that have "Pool" as one of their amenities.
10. **Size**: Find properties that have exactly 3 amenities (Hint: `$size`).

## 4. Sorting and Limiting
11. **Sort by Price**: List all properties sorted by price in descending order.
12. **Top 3**: Find the 3 most expensive properties.
13. **Oldest**: Find the oldest property in the dataset.

## 5. Aggregation
14. **Average Price**: Calculate the average price of all properties.
15. **Count by Type**: Count how many properties exist for each `type` (House, Condo, etc.).

## 6. Updates and Deletes
16. **Update Price**: The market has gone up! Increase the price of "P001" by $10,000.
17. **Add Amenity**: Add "Smart Lock" to the amenities list for property "P005".
18. **Delete**: Property "P015" has been de-listed. Remove it from the database.
